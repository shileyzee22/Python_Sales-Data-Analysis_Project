#Python Sales Data Analysis

This project demonstrates Python data analysis skills using Pandas and Matplotlib. It involves cleaning raw sales data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis to answer key business questions such as top-selling products, preferred payment methods, revenue trends, and city/manager performance. The goal is to simulate real-world data analyst tasks by turning messy data into actionable insights with clear visualizations.
